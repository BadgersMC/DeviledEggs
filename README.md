My first Minecraft plugin that I am developing alongside my Porject Orion, and Java Masterclass program. With great assistance from kangarko and ChatGPT4.

WARNING: Things get weird with a explosion power above 10. Then they get dangerous after 20. You've been warned. I shouldnt need to say this, but dont go crazy with this or you will crash your server. (although it is very fun to play with)
Recommended to keep between 3.5-5 for competitive style factions.
